      <h3>Jonathan Glass - the Artist</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Welcome, art-lovers, to my website! Although it has been created for the purpose of introducing you to my art as a whole, I'd like to introduce you, here, to the man behind the work. I am Jonathan Glass, I am an artist and a Jazz aficionado. And as with all great Jazz musicians, improvisation is at the heart of my work.

      Throughout my career, I have sought a continuity of expression between music and art. Each drawing lays a connective tissue to an important musical performance and its makers. I have been blessed to be exposed to the music of some of the great performers of our time. And I learn as much as I can about their stories as told through their music.</p>

      <p>In College, I majored in Illustration, studying under Alan E. Cober (Society of Illustrators Hall of Fame inductee). As my teacher and mentor, he taught me to journal my experiences in sketchbooks, helping me to personalize my story.

      It was during this period of my life that my grandfather was dying. And Alan encouraged me to use my sketching talents while I was visiting him in various homes for the elderly. He wanted me to discover the realities of daily existence for the people there, and to understand their histories. The insight I gained has been the psychological foundation for my drawings and watercolors, similar to the strength and fragility I reach for in my Jazz sketches.</p>

      <p>My college days were filled with highs and lows, culminating in a diagnosis of clinical depression shortly after graduation. I found solace in three integral mental health communities: <em>Post Graduate</em> brought group and art therapy together to help ground their members; The greatest mental health clubhouse, <em>Fountain House</em> and <em>Fountain Gallery</em>, encouraged its members to begin their journey to health through productivity in the context of a strong support system; and the <em>Art Students League</em> work-study program enabled me to hone my skills at a great non-accredited art school.

      Eventually, after a 5-year drought where my talents lay truly dormant, I was encouraged by a Post Graduate art therapist, and by teachers at the Art Students League, to nurture my creativity back to health. I will always remain grateful for their patience, guidance and understanding.</p>

      <p>My acceptance into the New York Jazz scene has been very gratifying and I have made lasting friendships with Jazz notables. Some have offered to sit for portraits, others have shown support by playing at my art openings in Jazz clubs around New York City.

      And today, if you were to ask me what I want my art to express, I'd say, whether I am drawing an elderly person in a street scene, or trying to capture the quixotic energy of today's greatest Jazz musicians, that my mission has always been to connect lives.</p>

        Jonathan took pastel and figurative studies from ages 10-18. He considers his passion to have started in his third year of college. Teacher Alan E. Cober taught journaling of experiences through sketchbook class. This was informative to develop his personal style of drawing.
      </p>
      <p>
        While Jonathan's grounding started with Cober, he continued to reconcile his notion of impermanence with jazz sketches. Some noted musicians have played at his openings. Some have sat for portratis in his studio (ie. Ravi Coltrane, Dan Tepfer, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important thing to his art is that whether painting or drawing, there has to be an element of improvisation, as well. Jonathan hopes that he could in some small way link the continuity of jazz from greats of the be-bop era to the standard bearers and hard boppers to avant-garde jazz and the beginnings of fusion and hip-hop.
